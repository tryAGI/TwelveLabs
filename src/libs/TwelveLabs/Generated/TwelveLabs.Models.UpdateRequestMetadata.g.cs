    /// Custom metadata for the knowledge store, as user-defined key-value pairs. Up to 10 pairs, keys up to 128 characters, string values up to 2048 characters. Keys are strings. Each value is a string, a number, a boolean, or an array of strings; a nested object, an array holding anything but strings, and a null value are rejected. An integer must fit in 53 bits (-9007199254740991 to 9007199254740991); send a wider value, and any identifier you want preserved verbatim, as a string. The provided object replaces the existing metadata in full, so include every key you want to keep, and drop a key by omitting it. To clear all metadata, set this field to an empty object (`{}`).
